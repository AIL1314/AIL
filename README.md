## About

The purpose of this repository is to organize and present our project to the group.


## Data

Conflict Database from: UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset (GED) Global version 17.1 (2016).
Hansen Forest Map: https://earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest
CHIRPS: Precipitation data.
Seddon index: VSI. Vegetation Sensitivity Index.

`UCDP`

This dataset is UCDP's most disaggregated dataset, covering individual events of organized violence (phenomena of lethal violence occurring at a given time and place). These events are sufficiently fine-grained to be geo-coded down to the level of individual villages, with temporal durations disaggregated to single, individudal days.

'HANSEN'

Trees are defined as vegetation taller than 5m in height and are expressed as a percentage per output grid cell as ‘2000 Percent Tree Cover’. ‘Forest Cover Loss’ is defined as a stand-replacement disturbance, or a change from a forest to non-forest state, during the period 2000–2015. ‘Forest Cover Gain’ is defined as the inverse of loss, or a non-forest to forest change entirely within the period 2000–2012. ‘Forest Loss Year’ is a disaggregation of total ‘Forest Loss’ to annual time scales.

'CHIRPS'


Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) is a 30+ year quasi-global rainfall dataset. Spanning 50°S-50°N (and all longitudes), starting in 1981 to near-present, CHIRPS incorporates 0.05° resolution satellite imagery with in-situ station data to create gridded rainfall time series for trend analysis and seasonal drought monitoring.

Each asset spans a pentad. Each of first 5 pentads in a month have 5 days. The last pentad contains all the days from the 26th to the end of the month.

The dataset contains one band: 'precipitation' (mm/pentad)

 'VSI'
Sensitivity of vegetation productivity (defined as EVI) to climate variability (based on temperature, water availability and cloudiness). The index ranges from 0 (low sensitivity, green) to 100 (high sensitivity, red).
